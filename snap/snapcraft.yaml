summary: Tiny client to talk to the Snap Store and Charmhub APIs.
description: |
    surl (store curl) is a small wrapper around curl which knows
    how to negotiate authentication for the Snap Store and Charmhub.

    It can be used as a general CLI client for those service APIs,
    by specifying the details of the user one wants to work as; surl
    takes care of negotiating authentication, asking for login credentials,
    storing and passing around the resulting macaroon tokens.
